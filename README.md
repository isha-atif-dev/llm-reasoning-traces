# LLM Reasoning Traces Project

This repository contains structured reasoning traces designed to demonstrate how a Large Language Model (LLM) can reason through technical tasks step by step.

Each trace follows a consistent format covering:
- Problem understanding
- Planning and decision-making
- Optional tool use
- Final solution
- Reflection and potential failure points

The goal of this project is to showcase clear, high-quality reasoning suitable for training and evaluating LLMs on real-world technical tasks.

## Why this project

This project mirrors real-world AI data training workflows, where human-authored reasoning traces are used to improve the reliability, consistency, and decision-making quality of large language models. The emphasis is on reasoning clarity and process quality rather than model outputs or performance metrics.
