Task:
Reflect on a reasoning process and identify how it can be improved over time.

Plan:
1. Review previous reasoning steps and decisions
2. Identify weaknesses or recurring issues
3. Define concrete ways to improve future reasoning

Actions:
- Analyse past reasoning traces for unclear steps or weak justifications
- Identify patterns such as unnecessary assumptions or inconsistent decisions
- Consider how feedback or evaluation criteria could guide improvements

Tool Use:
Tool: Reflective analysis
Input:
A set of completed reasoning traces

Observed Improvement Areas:
- Some steps could be explained more clearly
- Assumptions are not always stated explicitly
- Tool-use decisions could be justified more consistently

Final Answer:
Reasoning quality can be improved by making assumptions explicit, strengthening justifications, and consistently reviewing decisions against defined evaluation criteria. Iterative reflection helps refine reasoning patterns and reduce repeated mistakes.

Reflection:
Continuous improvement is essential for reliable reasoning systems. Learning from past decisions enables more consistent, transparent, and trustworthy outcomes over time.
