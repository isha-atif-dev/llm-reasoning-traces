Task:
Design an evaluation rubric to assess the quality of reasoning in technical problem-solving.

Plan:
1. Identify key aspects of good reasoning
2. Define clear criteria for evaluation
3. Ensure the rubric supports consistent and fair assessment

Actions:
- Review examples of correct and incorrect reasoning
- Identify dimensions such as clarity, consistency, and justification
- Define simple scoring levels for each dimension

Tool Use:
Tool: Conceptual evaluation
Input:
A set of reasoning traces for technical tasks

Observed Criteria:
- Logical consistency across steps
- Clear planning before actions
- Appropriate tool use decisions
- Justified final conclusions

Final Answer:
A reasoning evaluation rubric should assess clarity, consistency, and decision quality rather than just correctness. Using well-defined criteria enables consistent evaluation and helps identify strengths and weaknesses in reasoning processes.

Reflection:
Structured evaluation improves reliability when assessing reasoning quality. Clear rubrics reduce subjectivity and support meaningful comparison across different reasoning traces.
