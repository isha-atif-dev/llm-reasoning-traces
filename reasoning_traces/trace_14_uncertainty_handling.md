Task:
Handle uncertainty when required information is missing or incomplete.

Plan:
1. Identify what information is missing or uncertain
2. Assess how this uncertainty affects the decision
3. Decide how to proceed safely without making unsupported assumptions

Actions:
- Review the available data and identify missing or unclear fields
- Consider whether the task can be completed reliably with partial information
- Evaluate options such as asking for clarification, making cautious assumptions, or stopping the process

Tool Use:
Tool: Reasoning analysis
Input:
A dataset or task with incomplete or ambiguous information

Observed Uncertainty:
- Missing values in key fields
- Lack of clarity about data source or constraints
- Insufficient context to make a confident decision

Final Answer:
When critical information is missing, the system should avoid making strong assumptions. A safe response is to acknowledge uncertainty, explain its impact, and either request clarification or proceed with clearly stated limitations.

Reflection:
Explicitly handling uncertainty improves trust and prevents incorrect conclusions. Recognising what is not known is as important as reasoning about what is known.
