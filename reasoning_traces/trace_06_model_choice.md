Task:
Decide whether to use a simple or complex model for a given machine learning task.

Plan:
1. Understand the complexity of the problem and dataset
2. Consider the trade-off between interpretability and performance
3. Evaluate constraints such as data size and stability

Actions:
- Review the size and quality of the dataset
- Consider whether patterns appear simple or highly non-linear
- Evaluate the risk of overfitting with more complex models

Tool Use:
Tool: Conceptual evaluation
Input:
A structured dataset with a limited number of features

Observed Issues:
- Limited training data available
- Risk of overfitting with complex models
- Need for interpretability in decision-making

Final Answer:
A simpler model is preferred when data is limited and interpretability is important. Simple models are easier to analyse, more stable, and less likely to overfit, making them suitable for controlled or early-stage experiments.

Reflection:
Choosing a complex model too early can add unnecessary risk. Model selection should align with data availability, task requirements, and the need for reliable explanations.
