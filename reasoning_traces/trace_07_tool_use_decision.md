Task:
Decide whether a tool is required to solve a technical problem or if reasoning alone is sufficient.

Plan:
1. Understand the complexity of the task
2. Determine whether manual reasoning is reliable
3. Decide if using a tool adds clear value

Actions:
- Analyse the problem requirements
- Evaluate whether calculations or data inspection are needed
- Consider the risk of errors if done manually

Tool Use:
Tool: Decision evaluation
Input:
A task requiring simple logical reasoning without heavy computation

Observed Considerations:
- The problem can be solved through structured reasoning
- Tool usage would not significantly improve accuracy
- Manual reasoning avoids unnecessary complexity

Final Answer:
A tool is not required when the task involves straightforward logic and can be solved reliably through step-by-step reasoning. Tools should be used only when they meaningfully reduce error or handle complexity beyond manual reasoning.

Reflection:
Overusing tools can slow down workflows and introduce unnecessary dependencies. Effective reasoning includes knowing when not to use a tool.
