Task:
Analyse how ambiguous prompts can lead to incorrect or inconsistent outputs.

Plan:
1. Identify parts of the prompt that are unclear or underspecified
2. Consider multiple possible interpretations
3. Determine how ambiguity affects the final response

Actions:
- Review the original prompt and identify missing details
- Consider different reasonable interpretations of the same instruction
- Compare how each interpretation could lead to a different outcome

Tool Use:
Tool: Reasoning analysis
Input:
A prompt that lacks clear constraints or success criteria

Observed Issues:
- The task does not specify expected output format
- Important assumptions are left undefined
- Multiple interpretations are equally plausible

Final Answer:
Ambiguous prompts lead to inconsistent outputs because the system must guess missing information. Clear instructions reduce uncertainty by explicitly defining goals, constraints, and expected formats.

Reflection:
Prompt clarity is essential for reliable reasoning. Improving prompt specificity leads to more stable and predictable outcomes.
